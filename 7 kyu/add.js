// For this kata you will have to forget how to add two numbers.

// It can be best explained using the following meme:

// In simple terms, our method does not like the principle of carrying over numbers and just writes down every number it calculates :-)

// You may assume both integers are positive integers.

function add(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
  }
