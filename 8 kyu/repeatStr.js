//Write a function that accepts an integer n and a string s as parameters, and returns a string of s repeated exactly n times.

const repeatStr = (n, s) => s.repeat(n)

//The repeat() method constructs and returns a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together.
